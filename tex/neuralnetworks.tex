	\noindent \textit{Artificial neural networks} (ANNs) are widely used for nonlinear function approximation.
	(nonlinear classifier.)  They were initially inspired by the way biological neurons process information. 
	
	They are composed of interconnected processing units called artificial neurons, which are organized in layers and are capable of learning and generalizing from data.
