Abstract -- In various studies, researchers have described the activation functions that allow multilayer feedforward networks to act as universal approximators. However, we demonstrate that most of the characterizations presented in the literature are specific instances of the following general finding: A typical multilayer feedforward network that employs a locally bounded piecewise continuous activation function can accurately approximate any continuous function to an arbitrary degree if and only if the activation function is non-polynomial.
