	\section{What is Machine Learning}
	\noindent Machine Learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data. 
	
	(with the aim to solve a problem without being explicitly programmed.) \\ \\ 
	
	For example, 
	
	

	\section{Types of Learning}
	We can think about learning as the way we understand it as a human. We can learn . That is how we can classify the Machine Learning problem, based on the degree of feedback.
